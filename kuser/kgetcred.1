.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
obtains a ticket for a service.
Usually tickets for services are obtained automatically when needed
but sometimes for some odd reason you want to obtain a particular
ticket or of a special type.
.Pp
The second form applies hostname canonicalization using local name
canonicalization rules just as applications normally would, possibly
enabling canonicalization via referrals.
.Pp
Supported options:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl Fl canonicalize
requests that the KDC canonicalize the principal.
.It Fl Fl canonical
turns off local canonicalization of the principal.
.It Fl Fl name-type= Ns Ar name-type
the name-type to use when parsing the principal name.
.It Fl Fl hostbased
is short for
.Fl Fl name-type=srv_hst .
.It Fl c Ar cache , Fl Fl cache= Ns Ar cache
the credential cache to use.
.It Fl Fl delegation-credential-cache= Ns Ar cache
the credential cache to use for delegation.
.It Fl e Ar enctype , Fl Fl enctype= Ns Ar enctype
encryption type to use.
.It Fl Fl no-transit-check
requests that the KDC doesn't do transit checking.
.It Fl Fl forwardable
.It Fl Fl debug
enables debug output to stderr.
.It Fl Fl version
.It Fl Fl help
.El
.Pp
If the
.Fl Fl canonical
option is used, then no further canonicalization should be done locally
by the client (for example, DNS), but if
.Fl Fl canonicalize
is used, then the client will ask that the KDC canonicalize the name.
.Pp
If the
.Fl Fl canonicalize
option is used with
.Fl Fl hostbased
a host-based name-type, and
.Fl Fl canonical
is not used, then the hostname will be canonicalized according to the
name canonicalization rules in
.Va krb5.conf .
.Pp
GSS-API initiator applications with host-based services will get the
same behavior as using the
.Fl Fl canonicalize
.Fl Fl hostbased
options here.
