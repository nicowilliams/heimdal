.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
Dumps ASN.1 DER-encoded values.
If a
.Ar TypeName
is given, then
.Nm
will print the value in a JSON-like format using its knowledge of
the ASN.1 module defining that type.
If a
.Ar TypeName
is given, it must be the name of an ASN.1 type exported by an
ASN.1 module that is compiled into
.Nm .
Use the
.Fl Fl list-types
option to list ASN.1 types known to
.Nm .
