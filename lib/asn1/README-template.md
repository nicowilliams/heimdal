Notes about the template parser:

 - assumption: code is large, tables smaller

 - size scales better as features as added:

    - adding encoding rules, textual value parsers, comparators, and so on, are
      just new template interpreter, and generally that means no change to
      templates.

    - so template sizing scales like `O(M + N)` where `M` is the size of the
      modules and `N` is the size of the interpreters

    - but codegen sizing scales like `O(M * N)`

    - as we add interpreters the size advantage of templates increases

 - smaller tables and code, more memory sharing, smaller cache footprint,
   should lead to better performance

    - templates are shared for encode/decode/free/copy/print interpreters,
      whereas none of those operations as generated by the codegen backend
      share any code

 - how to generate template based stubs: it's the default!

   Use the `--template` option to `asn1_compile` to use the template backend,
   or leave it off to use the codegen backend.

 - the template backend now has more functionality than the codegen backend

 - much easier to extend!  adding new encoding rules is just adding a few
   functions to template.c, one set of length/encode/decode functions per ER,
   so we could add OER/PER/XDR/GSER/JER with very little work outside that one
   file and gen_template.c (to generate stub functions and possibly slight
   alterations to templates) and gen.c (to generate declarations of those stub
   functions).

TODO:
	- Fuzzing tests

	- Performance testing

	- ASN1_MALLOC_ENCODE() as a function, replaces encode_ and length_

	- Fix SIZE constraits

        - Proper implementation of `SET { ... }`

	- Compact types that only contain on entry to not having a header.

          Or maybe not.  We can afford larger template footprint if we can get
          more bang for that.  For example, if we add type and member names to
          the templates, we could have template interpreters that implement JER
          (JSON Encoding Rules) and/or GSER (Generic String Encoding Rules),
          and it will cost only the size of the new interpreters plust the
          extra metadata (type and member names).

          Perhaps we could rely on `dladdr()` to find the names of template
          data structures and work out the type and member names from that?
          But then, making more of those static / stripping them would save us
          some of the cost of adding type and member names to the templates.
          Using `dladdr()` might be a problem because it's not really portable,
          and our implementation in lib/roken for WIN32 does not report a
          symbol name, but there is a way to get that in WIN32
          (see https://github.com/dlfcn-win32/dlfcn-win32/).

          E.g., if we know the name of a template table as
          "asn1_TBSCertificate_tag_version_28" then we can work out that it's
          for the member named `version` in the type named `TBSCertificate`.
