     * We want to use issetugid(), but issetugid() is not the same on
     * all OSes.
     *
     * On Illumos derivatives, OpenBSD, and Solaris issetugid() returns
     * true IFF the program exec()ed was set-uid or set-gid.
     *
     * On NetBSD and FreeBSD issetugid() returns true if the program
     * exec()ed was set-uid or set-gid, or if the process has switched
     * UIDs/GIDs or otherwise changed privileges or is a descendant of
     * such a process and has not exec()ed since.
     *
     * What we want here is to know only if the program exec()ed was
     * set-uid or set-gid, so we can decide whether to trust the
     * enviroment variables.  We don't care if this was a process that
     * started as root and later changed UIDs/privs whatever: since it
     * started out as privileged, it inherited an environment from a
     * privileged pre-exec self, and so on, so the environment is
     * trusted.
     *
     * Therefore the FreeBSD/NetBSD issetugid() does us no good.
     *
     * Linux, meanwhile, has no issetugid() (at least glibc doesn't
     * anyways).
     *
     * Systems that support ELF put an "auxilliary vector" on the stack
     * prior to starting the RTLD, and this vector includes (optionally)
     * information about the process' EUID, RUID, EGID, RGID, and so on
     * at the time of exec(), which we can use to construct proper
     * issetugid() functionality.
     *
     * Where available, we use the ELF auxilliary vector as a fallback
     * if issetugid() is not available.
     *
     * All of this is true as of late March 2015, and might become stale
     * in the future.
