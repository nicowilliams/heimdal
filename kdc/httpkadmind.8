.Sh DESCRIPTION
Serves the following resources:
.Ar /get-keys and
.Ar /get-config .
.Pp
The
.Ar /get-keys
end-point allows callers to get keytab content for named
principals, possibly performing write operations such as creating
a non-existent principal, or rotating its keys, if requested.
.Pp
The
.Ar /get-config
end-point allows callers to get
.Nm krb5.conf
contents for a given principal.
.Pp
This service can run against a local HDB, or against a remote HDB
via the
.Nm kadmind(8)
protocol.
Read operations are always allowed, but write operations can be
preformed either against a given primary
.Nm kadmind(8)
server or redirected to another
.Nm httpkadmind(8).
.Pp
The
.Ar /get-config
end-point accepts a single query parameter:
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset indent
.It Ar princ=PRINCIPAL .
.El
.Pp
The
.Ar /get-keys
end-point accepts various parameters:
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset indent
.It Ar spn=PRINCIPAL
Names the host-based service principal whose keys to get.
May be given multiple times, and all named principal's keys will
be fetched.
.It Ar dNSName=HOSTNAME
Names the host-based service principal's hostname whose keys to get.
May be given multiple times, and all named principal's keys will
be fetched.
.It Ar service=SERVICE
Hostnames given with
.Ar dNSName=HOSTNAME
will be qualified with this service name to form a host-based
service principal.
May be given multiple times, in which case the cartesian product
of
.Ar dNSName=HOSTNAME
ad
.Ar service=SERVICE
will be used.
Defaults to
.Ar HTTP .
.It Ar enctypes=ENCTYPE,...
A comma-separated list of enctypes that the principal is expected
to support (used for Kerberos Ticket session key negotiation).
Defaults to the
.Ar supported_enctypes
configured in
.Nm krb5.conf(5) .
.It Ar materialize=true
If the named principal(s) is (are) virtual, this will cause it
(them) to be materialized as a concrete principal.
.It Ar create=true
If the named principal(s) does not (do not) exist, this will
cause it (them) to be created.
.It Ar rotate=true
This will cause the keys of concrete principals to be rotated.
.It Ar revoke=true
This will cause old keys of concrete principals to be deleted
if their keys are being rotated.
This means that extant service tickets with those principals as
the target will not be able to be decrypted by the caller as it
will not have the necessary keys.
.El
.Pp
Authorization is handled via the same mechanism as in
.Nm bx509d(8)
which was originally intended to authorize certification requests
(CSRs).
See
.Nm krb5.conf(5) .
